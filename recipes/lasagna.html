   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>1 large yellow onion or enough for one cup</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>28 ounces tomato puree</li>
    <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>
    <li>14.5 ounces diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>6 ounces tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons basil</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 box lasagna noodles</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Cottage Cheese Mixture</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>30 ounces full fat cottage cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>4-5 cups shredded mozzarella</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Heat a large pot or Dutch oven on medium heat. Add the olive oil.</li>
    <li>Add the onion and garlic and saute until soft, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and cook until brown.</li>
    <li>Add the puree, sauce, diced tomatoes, paste, sugar, basil, salt, oregano, pepper, and bay leaves. Stir until well combined.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat. Cover and simmer for at least 45 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350° F.</li>
    <li>Place a few long sheets of wax paper onto a clean work surface, and spray with cooking spray. In a large pot, cook lasagna noodles according to manufacturer’s directions. Drain and place noodles flat onto the wax paper while the sauce continues to cook.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Cottage Cheese Mixture</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, beat the egg.</li>
    <li>Add the cottage cheese, 3/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese, and parsley. Mix until well combined.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Lasagna Assembly</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Generously coat a deep 9 X 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray, and layer a rimmed baking pan with tin foil. Remove the bay leaves from the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Place a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Put 4 lasagna noodles on top of the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/3 of the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
    <li>Completely cover with about 2 cups of sauce, making sure to spread the sauce into the corners and along the edges.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the mozzarella over the sauce.</li>
    <li>Place 4 lasagna noodles over the mozzarella and repeat the order of layering.</li>
    <li>Place lasagna noodles over the final cottage cheese/mozzarella layer and cover with sauce.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheeses over the sauce.</li>
    <li>Place the pan of lasagna onto the foil-lined baking sheet. This allows for easier clean-up should it bubble over in the oven or spill over when cutting into at the table.</li>
    <li>Bake for 50 minutes or until bubbly. If you should notice cheese beginning to brown, cover lightly with a sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Note: To prevent a watery lasagna, be sure to use a <strong>full-fat cottage cheese</strong>.</p>
